            <h2>Haiti's Rich History</h2>
            <div class="history-card">
                <p>Haiti holds a remarkable place in world history as the first Black republic and the first nation to be founded by formerly enslaved people. Originally inhabited by the Taíno people, the island of Hispaniola was colonized by the Spanish and later by the French, who established a thriving colony called Saint-Domingue. It became one of the richest colonies in the world due to its sugar, coffee, and indigo production—built entirely on the backs of enslaved Africans. Inspired by the French Revolution and driven by the brutality of slavery, a massive slave uprising began in 1791, led by revolutionary figures like Toussaint Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and Henri Christophe. After more than a decade of brutal conflict, the Haitian people defeated Napoleon's forces and declared independence on January 1, 1804.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="history-card">
                <p>The creation of Haiti was a watershed moment not only in the Americas but globally—it was a direct challenge to colonialism and white supremacy. Haiti’s independence sent shockwaves through the slaveholding world and offered inspiration to freedom movements across Latin America and the United States. However, the cost of freedom was high. The new republic faced economic isolation, political instability, and a crippling indemnity imposed by France in 1825 in exchange for recognition—equivalent to billions in today’s money. Despite these immense obstacles, Haiti has maintained a resilient national identity rooted in pride, revolution, and cultural richness. Its history remains a powerful testament to the fight for freedom and human dignity.</p>
